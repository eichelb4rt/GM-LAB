# Graphical Models LAB final project

## Render Graphs

Adjacency matrices are stored in `.npy` files in the `graphs` directory and can be rendered with `./render.sh <filename>`. The results will be stored in the `renders` directory as `.png` files.

### Examples

```text
./render.sh graphs/full.npy
```
